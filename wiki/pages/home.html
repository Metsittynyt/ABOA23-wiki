          <p>
            Harmful compounds are continuously released to the environment by human activities. Mercury is one of them
            and
            according to the World Health Organization it is one of the 10 chemicals of major public health concern.
            Mercury sources are primarily coal combustion, industrial use, mining and waste incineration

              (USGS, 2019)</a>. The emissions travel long distances and mercury remains in nature for an extremely long
            time <a

            <br><br>
            As mercury pollution is a global problem, mercury and its most toxic form methylmercury also cause local
            issues. Finland is a land of many marshlands and lakes. These marshlands have been drained overtime to be
            used
            for agriculture and forestry. As the result of the ditching process the dangerous methylmercury that has
            bioaccumulated to the biomass for centuries, is released to nearby water bodies in the runoff water and then
            the Baltic Sea.

              Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that damages lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. It causes individuals to have
              weakened immune system, problems with their digestive system and damaged nervous system. It also harms
              the
              development of young children and fetuses.

              <br><br>
              Mercury can be found naturally from the atmosphere, bodies of water and soil. The most toxic form of
              mercury
              is methylmercury. It binds into organic substances and enriches in the food chains. Methylmercury has a
              harmful impact on behavioral, neurological and reproductive functions in animals. (<a

              methylmercury most often by consuming large predator fish and crustaceans that have high concentrations

          <p>
            The current solution to remove mercury from water is to filter it. There are various methods to filter
            mercury
            such as reverse osmosis filters and water distillers which both require a lot of energy <a
              href="https://www.drinkaquagear.com/blogs/news/how-to-remove-mercury-from-water">(aquagear, 2021).</a>.
            Chemical methods use chemical substances such as ferric salts or sulfide to produce a sludge with ionic
            mercury <a
              href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-08/documents/treat_tech_mercury_542r07003.pdf">(U.S.
              Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation,
              2007)</a>. This method is inexpensive but is not sustainable as chemicals are industrial products that
            require
            energy and raw materials to be produced and they create waste.
