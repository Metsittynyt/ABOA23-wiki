      <p>Usually when we think about the word education we start reminiscing about our school days. While schools and
        universities are a major part of our education, we believe the journey shouldn’t stop there. Thus in our iGEM
        journey we wanted to include the full scale of ages: children, preschoolers, high schoolers, adults and elderly.
        We know that education is a lifelong journey and this is how we approached this special prize.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Every day we have to make decisions and lack of knowledge can make us choose the wrong path. Education can
        change this: education brings knowledge and so it brings trust. With trust we can work together and as united we
        can change this world.
      </p>

    <hr style="background-color: transparent; height: 50px;">
    <p>We started our journey with 2 to 5 year olds. We met with Aino Kiviniemi, a local pre-school teacher, to discuss
      children’s learning abilities and concentration skills. We learned that children are captivated more easily if a
      story is included in the tasks they are doing. Also colors and working with their own hands helps them to
      concentrate and understand different concepts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="col-lg-7" id="text">
      <p>
        After we learned, it was the children's turn to learn. To introduce synthetic biology in simpler terms we
        organized a cell building workshop: the children got to decorate styrofoam balls, the cells, in order to learn
        about modifying cell’s functions. We listened to Aino’s advice and told the children that Doctor Dolphin needs
        their help to decorate the dull empty balls into colorful working cells. We asked the children what kind of
        cells
        they built and we got a lot of creative answers: some cells could jump to space, others could create balloons
        and
        some live under the table.

        According to Aino the kids can be quite messy sometimes and that got us thinking about the importance of
        cleanliness in lab work. Therefore the second workshop we organized for the children was about lab safety and
        working without making a mess. We first talked about the rules of the lab and explained them with pictures. Then
        to give them a taste of lab work: the children got to perform a simple experiment with baking soda and vinegar
        that was dyed with food dye.

    <p>
      Then our journey takes a turn down a memory lane: we visited Sara’s and Mariel’s old upper secondary school
      called
      Kulosaaren Yhteiskoulu.

        The class we taught have their matriculation exams coming up in Autumn and part of the biology exam is about
        the
        applications of biology which includes gene modification, synthetic biology and the different techniques. To
        help
        the students we explained some gene modification terms and went over different techniques and requirements
        they
        hold. In addition we know how tiring it is to stare at the same text book images over and over again, so we
        made
        an educational comic for them about the basis of gene modification.

      Besides the exams and studying we wanted to encourage innovative thinking and together talk about the
      possibilities that university, synthetic biology and iGEM brings. At the end of our presentation about our
      project
      and iGEM we asked the students to brainstorm their own iGEM project ideas in small groups. Various great project
      ideas came up such as fighting malaria with synthetic biology tools, inventing a protein that detoxifies blood
      and
      many more. It was wonderful to see how the students really got to thinking and hear that some even talked about
      their idea when leaving the class to recess.

    <hr style="background-color: transparent; height: 50px;">
    <p>
      To reach young adults we knew to turn to the social media department. We made an educational campaign on
      Instagram
      about synthetic biology, different terms regarding it and our project. Scientific communication is often quite
      challenging because you have to keep things simple and interesting but at the same time have the facts correct.
      To
      help with this we looked through what other iGEM teams have done in the past and tried to learn from them. We
      decided to go with a news inspired campaign which was called Today in Synthetic Biology with ABOA and we posted
      these on Instagram.

    <p>
      We were invited to the Bioindustries conference on the 19th of April. There experts from various organizations
      and
      companies held presentations. We learned a lot for example about the recent developments, struggles and
      solutions
      the bioindustry has right now. Although the experts have traveled a longer educational journey than we have, we
      believe we taught them something too. We held a presentation about iGEM, our project and how we, young
      scientists,
      are entering this diverse field. After the presentations there was reserved time for casual conversations. We
      got
      to talk, ask and answer questions from these experts and also the 2022 Aalto-Helsinki team.
