          On this page we have gathered all the contributions we have made for the iGEM community. This journey has
          had
          its ups and downs. And those ups and downs have been the most instructive moments during this experience.
          They
          have taught us a lot and we feel that by sharing those moments we can help future teams navigate through
          their
          project a little easier. Since the project is not only about the lab, we wanted to make sure to add
          contributions from other sub teams as well.

                <p>
                  Our team has added 4 new genes to the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The codons of the
                  genes are optimized specially for Synechocystis. In addition to these, 10 basic parts and
                  were added to the iGEM Registry. Our parts can be used by future iGEM teams for mercury
                  bioremediation. Hopefully, the parts will take our project even further or apply them to something
                  new
                  in the hands of future iGEM teams!

                <h3>Expanding iGEM community</h3>
                <h4>Turku iGEM community</h4>
                <p>
                  Team ABOA 2023 managed to do something new. It united students and different universities in Turku.
                  Starting off with mostly bio-students we soon realized there should be more diversity in know-how.
                  New
                  team members were added to the team and so the complete ABOA 2023 team was finally formed. This
                  year’s
                  team was not only formed by students from the University of Turku but also students from Åbo Akademi
                  and
                  Turku University of applied sciences (UAS). Because diversity and unity are two of our team values,
                  we
                  want to continue the unity between the universities also in the future and will reach out to new
                  faculties when possible. We will assist the new team ABOA 2024 to a great start when passing on the
                  baton and helping them in every possible way.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Finnish iGEM community</h4>
                <p>
                  Being a young team we did not yet have a wide network to support us. We have reached out to
                  different
                  companies, the press, institutions and different communities thereby making iGEM better known to the
                  wider public in Finland.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Our team has also been working closely with the other Finnish team Aalto-Helsinki. We hope to
                  maintain
                  a
                  good relationship between the Finnish teams and encourage other universities across Finland to
                  establish
                  their own iGEM teams. We have been discussing with Sekvenssi ry, the Club of Synthetic Biology,
                  board
                  of
                  having their members from Tampere join team ABOA next year. This will spread the iGEM community to
                  Tampere and the start of a possible new team in Finland.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Nordic iGEM community</h4>
                <p>
                  Thus far there are only two iGEM teams in Finland. For this reason maintaining a good relationship
                  with
                  the wider Nordic iGEM community is important because of the joined support and unity. By winning
                  this
                  year’s Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) we got the great honor to host NiC 2024 and pass on the “golden
                  pipette” to the next year’s winner.

                  As said on our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/aboa-turku/education">education page</a>, education
                  is
                  a
                  lifelong journey that does not end at graduation. We took
                  all age groups into consideration when working on our project’s educational section. It took a lot
                  of
                  time, work and planning to come up with materials suitable for each particular age group. By sharing
                  our
                  educational materials we hope future teams will make good use of them and all age groups could be
                  included in synthetic biology in the future as well. All materials are collected in the following
                  PDF
                  file.

                <p>
                  ABOA is a fairly new team in the iGEM community. This comes with its own challenges, one being
                  finances.
                  Companies have been hesitant to sponsor our team’s iGEM journey as it is new and not widely known.
                  In
                  addition to contacting companies we came up with new innovative ways of raising money: crowdfunding
                  and
                  workshops.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Crowdfunding</h3>
                <p>
                  We set up our crowdfunding through Kulttuurilahja platform. Being accepted to Kulttuurilahja
                  required
                  us
                  to write an overview of our project, marketing strategy and advertisement pictures. Kansan
                  Sivistysrahasto supported the project by donating an additional 20 % to all donations made.
                  Crowdfunding
                  is a good way to raise money but in order to be successful it requires a good marketing plan to gain
                  visibility. During the summer holidays it is harder to raise funds and that is why visibility and
                  timing
                  are key elements in succession.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Workshops</h3>
                <p>
                  In addition to crowdfunding we got funds from a synthetic biology workshop that was held by our team
                  in
                  order to raise money and awareness of synthetic biology. A lot of time and planning is required to
                  organize these workshops. Our workshop was aimed at the working population with an interest in lab
                  work
                  and synthetic biology. A suitable space for the workshop needed to be arranged as well as all the
                  materials and simple yet interesting lab work. In order to succeed, the marketing needed to be
                  directed
                  at the working population who are willing to pay for this experience. Unfortunately our workshop did
                  not
                  go through.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Marketing</h3>
                <p>
                  As said previously, marketing has a key role in fundraising. It is important to understand your
                  target
                  audience and make content suitable for them. Crowdfunding was advertised on social media (Instagram,
                  LinkedIn, Facebook, ABOA website) on both personal and team accounts. This helped us to reach
                  family,
                  friends and acquaintances.
                  Taking part in events gave visibility and a way to make iGEM better known to the wider public and
                  raise
                  funds. We took part in the Study in Turku event that gave us a change to make iGEM better known to
                  the
                  wider public, especially students. Our workshop and crowdfunding flyers were on display at the
                  event.
                  For the workshop we needed to target a whole new audience. We contacted local influencers who would
                  be
                  interested in doing a collaboration. They got to attend our workshop for free in exchange for
                  advertising our workshop on their social media. This collaboration reached many viewers that we
                  otherwise would not have reached. Marketing coming directly from a better known person makes people
                  more
                  willing to spend their money.
