        <p>
          On this page we have gathered all the contributions we’ve made for the iGEM community. This journey has its
          ups and downs. And those ups and downs have been the most instructive moments during this experience. They
          have
          taught us a lot and we feel that by contributing those moments we can help future teams navigate through their
          project a little easier. Since the project isn’t only about the lab we wanted to make sure to add
          contributions
          from other sub teams as well.

                As said on our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/aboa-turku/education">education page</a>, education is a
                lifelong journey that doesn't end at graduation. We took
                all age groups into consideration when working on our project’s education. It took a lot of time, work
                and planning to come up with materials suitable for each particular age group. By giving our materials
                we hope future teams will make good use of them and all age groups could be included in synthetic
                biology in the future as well. All materials are collected on the following PDF file.

                ABOA is a fairly new team in the iGEM community. This comes with its own challenges, one being finances.
                Companies have been hesitant to sponsor our team’s iGEM journey as it is new and not widely known. In
                addition to contacting companies we came up with new innovative ways of raising money: crowdfunding and
                workshops.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Crowdfunding</h3>
              <p>
                We set up our crowdfunding through Kulttuurilahja platform. Being accepted to Kulttuurilahja required us
                to write an overview of our project, marketing strategy and advertisement pictures. Kansan
                Sivistysrahasto supported the project by donating an additional 20 % to all donations made. Crowdfunding
                is a good way to raise money but in order to be successful it requires a good marketing plan to gain
                visibility. During the summer holidays it is harder to raise funds and that is why visibility and timing
                are key elements in succession.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Workshops</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to crowdfunding we got funds from a synthetic biology workshop that was held by our team in
                order to raise money and awareness of synthetic biology. A lot of time and planning is required to
                organize these workshops. Our workshop was aimed at the working population with an interest in lab work
                and synthetic biology. A suitable space for the workshop needed to be arranged as well as all the
                materials and simple yet interesting lab work. In order to succeed, the marketing needed to be directed
                at the working population who are willing to pay for this experience.
