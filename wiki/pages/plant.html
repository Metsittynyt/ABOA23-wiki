          The most used, sugar requiring chassis in iGEM and molecular biology, <span id="cursive">Escherichia
            coli</span>, is one of the tools our project, Merculess, used to build constructs. But for our primary
          chassis we wanted the CO2 utilizing photosynthetic model organism <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> sp.
          PCC 6803. The model organismâ€™s genome is known and many molecular engineering tools have been developed for
          it, but there is still a lot of research needed. We wanted to promote the research done on it because of the
          potential this light-driven chassis shows for different renewable applications that utilize CO2 as the primary
          carbon source. There is a global need for new sustainable biotechnologies and with <span
            id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> we can fill this need and apply it to many industries.

              <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> has many special attributes, most importantly its photosynthetic
              qualities. This means all the energy needed for growth and metabolism it gets from light and carbon
              dioxide
              (CO2). This is a huge advantage because there are plenty of the required primary sources.
              <br><br>
              <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> has been compared to <span id="cursive">E.Coli</span> as being the
              model organism of photosynthesis. Therefore, there has been plenty of research done around the chassis.
              The
              research has given us the proper tools and protocols to work with. In addition to this, the Department of
              Molecular Biology at the University of Turku has been doing research on <span
                id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> for years, so we had the proper infrastructure and knowhow at our
              hands
              for this project.

            Our most important tools when working with <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> are knowledge and
            experience of building constructs with this organism. We had the required knowhow on genetic regulation
            elements that allowed us to make reasoned decisions and well working constructs. On top of this <span
              id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> is naturally competent so it has the inherent ability to take up and
            incorporate foreign DNA into its genome without any special treatment that is usually required.
            <br><br>
            In our project, Merculess, we wanted to use <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> as our chassis for many
            reasons. One reason was research done around mercury metabolism in the organism. It is known that <span
              id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> has a native <span id="cursive">merA</span> gene and mercury-regulators
            which we utilize (Singh et al., 2019). And most importantly because of its photosynthetic abilities it was
            the
            right chassis for us.

        <p>
          Our aim was to modify <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> to convert extremely toxic methylmercury into
          its less toxic elemental form. This would be accomplished by the overexpression of two enzymes closely related
          to the conversion of methylmercury. We decided to achieve our aim by designing and optimizing a construct for
          overexpressing both mercuric reductase (MerA) and alkylmercury lyase (MerB). Our genes of interest originated
          from several different organisms (<span id="cursive">E. Coli</span>, <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span>
          and <span id="cursive">Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</span>). The chosen genes could be expressed either individually
          or together in an operon so that a single construct will express both genes. This allows us the possibility of
          determining which genes work the most efficiently.
          <br><br>
          We built our constructs using a Golden Gate based assembly system that had recently been developed by the
          Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Turku and already had a library for us to use. This
          particular system enables the construction of expression plasmids in a single step assembly reaction. The
          assembly system has been developed specifically for the expression of heterologous genes and its purpose is to
          make it possible to easily optimize the translation of genes by allowing flexible variation of RBSs, which
          makes it the right choice for our needs of modularity. This approach enables the building of an efficient
          expression system of <span id="cursive">merA</span> and <span id="cursive">merB</span> genes with optimized
          RBSs. There are currently no <span id="cursive">in silico</span> models for the selection of the most
          efficient RBSs for Synechocystis so we had to find one by trial and error and with help from literature. For
          our experiments we chose three different RBS sequences that had been found promising. By choosing an inducible
          promoter, the transcription of the genes and thus the bioremediation process are controllable.
          <br><br>
          The goal of our engineering is to give information and tools regarding mercury metabolism of <span
            id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> and its use as a motor for converting methylmercury into elemental
          mercury. In addition, the work we did on the Golden Gate based assembly system gives valuable information
          about its function. This approach creates the possibility of efficient <span id="cursive">merA</span> and
          <span id="cursive">merB</span> gene expression in <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> but in addition lays
          groundwork for research regarding mercury metabolism.

        <br>
        <p>
          <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> is an important photoautotrophic chassis for testing and learning, and
          will be an important one in the future as well. The special attributes of <span
            id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> make it a great platform for new renewable solutions, and work as a
          stepping stone for widening the usage of cyanobacteria. The research done on <span
            id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> can help expand the host range as the tools developed for it could be used
          for biotechnological applications that need other cyano strains with more suitable qualities.
          <br><br>
          <span id="cursive">Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</span> strain has been used in previous iGEM projects as well.
          We collaborated with the iGEM team of
          <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/edinburgh/index.html">Edinburgh</a>
          about using <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span>. We
          discussed the potential of our photoautotrophic chassis and in addition for example the time restrictions that
          the slower growth pace of the autotrophic <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> has compared to the
          heterotrophic E. Coli. With good design <span id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> is a very potential organism
          for future light-driven projects, also in the scope of iGEM.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          New biotechnologies using photoautotrophic microbes are and will be developed for diverse applications. For
          instance, with our MercuLess truck, we can take part in ensuring clean habitats, ecological balances and the
          safe use of fish by remediating the mercury contaminated bodies of water with <span
            id="cursive">Synechocystis</span> whilst using easily available energy sources, light and carbon dioxide.
          The development from the current situation into a future with different photoautotrophic organism based
          applications requires wider research, development of infrastructure, time and investments. Still our research,
          as each one in this field, takes us toward a light-driven future.
