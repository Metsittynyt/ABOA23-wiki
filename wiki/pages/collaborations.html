      Even though collaborations are not part of the medal criteria we know how valuable it is to work with others and
      we didn’t want to let go of that part of the competition. One of our project values is unity and collaborations
      are one way of honoring it.

              We first met on the 9th of May on Zoom. We talked about our project topics, planned our possible
              collaborations and got to know each other. After some research and planning we decided to continue the

          Both of our projects are related to bioremediation and therefore we wanted to have a joint talk about it. We
          first introduced iGEM, our project and then went over what bioremediation is, what advantages and

              Nordic and Baltic iGEM teams. This year’s NiC was hosted by the lovely iGEM SDU. We had inspirational
              events
              planned for the weekend: lectures about wiki writing and how to hold a presentation, a panel of iGEM
              alumni
              and even a Hackathon.On top of these we presented our projects and had time to get to know each other.

              We won the conference and now the Golden Pipet and the honor to host next year has been passed onto us. We
              will gladly continue this tradition and hope that we can make the conference as wonderful as it was this
              year.

              bring people together who are interested in synthetic biology. The association was interested in the iGEM
              competition so we introduced it to them, talked about the different requirements and about our team. We
              want to help them with their first steps regarding iGEM and possibly next year some of them could join our
              ABOA team. In the future when they have established a stable ground for themselves we want to be there to
